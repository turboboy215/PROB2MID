Song table
=======================================
The song table consists of 16-bit (2 byte) pointers to each song (or sound effect?). It can be found with the following code:
	asl	A
	mov	X,A
	mov	A,!MusicTable+0+X
	mov	TunePtr,A
	mov	A,!MusicTable+1+X
	mov	TunePtr+1,A
	mov	A,#0
	call	!TriggerTrack

Which equals the following in hex:
1C 5D F5 ?? ??

The song table ends with the ASCII string "PRIOR" in later games.

Song header
=======================================
The song header uses the same format as the Game Boy version, except that pointers are big-endian. Pointers here are relative to the start of each individual song rather than its absolute pointer in the audio RAM.
1. Number of channels
2-3. Pointer to a channel (repeat for total # of channels)

Sequence commands
===================
Sequences are comprised of the following commands:
00 xx (yy) = Rest, X = Length, if X >= 80, then use delta formula (see below)
xx yy (zz) (01-7F) = Play note (X), volume (Y), length (Z) (if set to manual - if Z >= 80, then use delta formula (see below)) - NOTE: early games (e.g. Chuck Rock) do not have a volume parameter, so only 1-3 bytes are used rather than 2-4.
8x (y) = Delay
9x = Set note length
E0 = Repeat previous note (A0 in early games)
E1 xx = Set length of notes to be variable (A1 in early games)
E2-EA = (Unused in earlier games, although E4 xx and E9 xx are used in later games)
EB xx = Set tremolo delay
EC xx = Set tremolo length
ED xx = Set tremolo
EE xx = Set vibrato delay
EF xx = Set vibrato length
F0 xx = Set vibrato
F1 = End of channel (loop with faster tempo)
F2 = End of channel (play next song)
F3 = Velocity control off
F4 = Velocity control on
F5 = Wipe echo workspace
F6 = Turn pitch modulation off
F7 xx = Turn pitch modulation on
F8 = End of channel (loop)
F9 xx = Trigger a track
FA = Turn echo off
FB = Turn echo on
FC xx = Effects
FD xx = Set tempo (the larger number, the slower the tempo)
FE xx = Set instrument
FF = End of channel (no loop)

Delta formula:
xx yy
If Y is divisible by 2, then length is (255 * (Y / 2)) + (x - 128)
Otherwise, length is ((y / 2) * 255) + (x - 128)

Sequence commands (V2)
===================
xx (yy) = Delay - then commands and then notes (if x is greater than 80, then use y to extend number, subtract 8000)
xx yy = Play note (x = note, y = volume)
8x yy  = Rest for period of time
9x = Set vibrato?
9F xx = Change note size
9F 8x yy = Change note size (long) (subtract 8000)
Ax-Bx yy = Rest
F0 xx = ?
F1 xx = Set panning?
F2 xx = Set echo
FA xx = Repeat section # of times (0 = infinite)
FB xx = End of repeat section
FC xx = Set tempo
FD xx = (Skip)
FE xx = Set instrument
FF xx = End of sequence
