Text string
===================
At the beginning of the sound data is the text string "(C)Probe" in ASCII.

Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table consists of 16-bit (2 byte) values. It can be found using the following code:
pop af
add a
ld h, 00
add l, a
ld de, SongTable
add hl, de

Which equals the following in hex:
F1 87 26 00 6F 11 ?? ?? 19

Song header
===================
Like Climax's "IMEDGBoy" format, pointers here are relative to the start of each individual song rather than its absolute pointer in the bank.
1. Number of channels (these are mapped via the instruments(?) to which of the 4 GB channels are used)
2-3. Pointer to a channel (repeat for total # of channels)

Sequence commands
===================
Sequences are comprised of the following commands:
xx (yy) = Delay - then commands and then notes (if x is greater than 80, then use y to extend number, subtract 8000)
xx yy = Play note (x = note, y = volume)
8x yy  = Rest for period of time
9x = Set vibrato?
9F xx = Change note size
9F 8x yy = Change note size (long) (subtract 8000)
Ax-Bx yy = Rest
F1 xx = Set envelope effect (1-4)
F2 xx = Set SFX priority?
F5 xx = Set bit 1 of envelope to 1
F6 xx = Set bit 1 of envelope to 0
F7 xx = ?
F8 xx = Set SFX priority? (same as F2)
F9 xx = Set bit 1 if envelope to 1 (v2)?
FA xx = Repeat section # of times (0 = infinite)
FB xx = End of repeat section
FC xx = Set tempo
FD xx = (Skip)
FE xx = Set instrument
FF xx = End of sequence
